For use in my system's librarian course.
## Some systems we are using 

  * VMs
  * Bash
  * GitHub
  * Nano
  * Markup Language

There will be more in future weeks.

I added this line in VM on Feb. 5th, 2026

## Notes from Week 5
I someone created 2 README.md files.  I deleted one using the command rm

## Notes on using grep
* Used cntrl Z to return to the shell when "lost"
*cat used to combine file but also opened the file
*Logout will close Linux
*grep -vic "article"
"grep -oi "^[a-z*]" savedrecs.bib | sort |uniq -c count of articles

## Notes from additional practice Feb. 15th
	* Repetition is key
	* Flashcard Program - each time I use it is is helpful
	* Less = view and paginate text files
	* Repetition with grep crucial
	* Cat will allow you to view the file
	* structure is grep -ic or -in  "" file

> forgot i need nano to edit text file
